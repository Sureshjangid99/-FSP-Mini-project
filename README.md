## üìñ About This Project
This project is a data analysis and strategy-building exercise for a quick-commerce startup facing operational issues. The primary goal is to use a data-driven approach to diagnose the company's core operational problems, analyze delivery and customer data using statistical concepts, and present a recovery strategy based on the findings. The ultimate objective is to solve these underlying issues to improve customer satisfaction and increase growth.

## Problem statement 

The analysis revealed several critical issues the startup is facing:
Inefficient Deliveries: Compared to competitors like Zepto and Blinkit, average delivery times are twice as high in some high-traffic zones. This inefficiency is strongly correlated with negative customer ratings and dissatisfaction.
Poor Inventory Management: The company often runs out of stock for high-demand products, leading to a poor customer experience and abandoned orders.
Customer Churn: A summary of customer feedback shows the top complaints are late deliveries and item unavailability. This has led to a sharp increase in customer churn and app uninstalls.
Declining Revenue: There has been a significant decline in Average Order Value (AOV) over the last two quarters, showing that customers are spending less per order.


## ‚ú® Key Features

To address the problems, the following data analysis steps were performed:

#Statistical Analysis: Discovered a high variance in delivery times, with a mean of 48 minutes but a median of only 28 minutes, indicating that a few very late orders were skewing the average.

#Correlation Mapping: Using a heatmap in Orange, a relationship was identified between specific "Pincodes" and the frequency of "Late Deliveries". The analysis also found a strong correlation between delays and orders placed after 6 PM.

#Geospatial Analysis: Used GeoGebra to map late orders, revealing three specific "hotspot" neighborhoods. The probability of a late delivery in these zones during peak hours was calculated to be over 70%.

#Data Visualization: Leveraged Orange's "Distributions" widget to visualize the spread and patterns of key variables like delivery times and customer ratings.


## The Strategy & Solution

*Based on the analysis, a targeted, data-driven recovery plan was developed and visualized using Flourish:

*Pre-position Riders: Station riders near the identified hotspots before the evening rush begins.

*Batch Orders: Group orders together in dense areas to improve efficiency.

*Offer Discounts: Introduce off-peak discounts to manage order flow.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Google Sheets: Used for initial planning and setting deadlines among team members.

Orange: For creating heatmaps to identify correlations and using distribution widgets to understand data patterns.

GeoGebra: To map late orders and visually identify "hotspot" neighborhoods with high delay probabilities.

Flourish: To create visualizations for the proposed targeted recovery plan.

Napkin AI: Used for creating the Order Journey Map.



## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*This is a list of the software and tools you will need to reproduce the analysis presented in this project:

*Google Sheets: Used for initial planning and setting project deadlines.

*Orange: Employed for data analysis, including finding correlations between variables , visualizing data with "Distributions" widgets , and creating heatmaps.

*GeoGebra: Needed to map late orders and visually identify the three "hotspot" neighborhoods

*Napkin AI: Used to create the Order Journey Map.


### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
2.  
 https://github.com/Sureshjangid99

** This project is a data analysis study and does not require a traditional software installation. 

The setup process involves ensuring you have access to the necessary data analysis tools and the project's dataset. ** 


## Install the Required Software:
Orange Data Mining: Download and install the application from the official Orange website. This will be used for the core data analysis, visualization, and creating heatmaps.

GeoGebra: Download and install the application from its official website. This is needed for mapping the late delivery data.


## Access Web-Based Tools:
Google Sheets, Flourish, and Napkin AI are web-based services. No installation is required, but you may need to register for an account on their respective websites.

## Prepare the Dataset:
The first step of the analysis is to import the provided datasets into the tools. Make sure you have the project data files available on your local machine.
